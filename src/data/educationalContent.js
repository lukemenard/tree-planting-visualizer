  nativeSpecies: {
    title: 'Why Native Species Matter',
    body: 'Native trees co-evolved with local wildlife, providing food and habitat for birds, pollinators, and beneficial insects. They are adapted to local soil and climate, requiring less water, fertilizer, and pest management. Planting natives strengthens the ecological web that sustains entire ecosystems.',

  heatIsland: {
    title: 'Urban Heat Island Effect',
    body: 'Cities can be 5-10\u00B0F hotter than surrounding rural areas because pavement and buildings absorb and re-radiate heat. Trees combat this by shading surfaces, reflecting sunlight, and releasing water vapor through transpiration. A single mature tree can cool the surrounding area by up to 9\u00B0F.',

  },

  carbonSequestration: {
    title: 'How Trees Store Carbon',
    body: 'Trees absorb CO2 from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, converting it into wood, leaves, and roots. A typical urban tree sequesters 10-25 kg of CO2 per year, with peak absorption during its fastest growth years (ages 10-30). Over its lifetime, one large tree can store over a tonne of carbon.',

  canopyCoverage: {
    title: 'Canopy Coverage Goals',
    body: 'Urban forestry experts recommend 30-40% canopy coverage for residential neighborhoods. Higher canopy coverage reduces energy costs (up to 25% less air conditioning), increases property values by 3-15%, and reduces stormwater runoff by intercepting rainfall. Many US cities currently sit below 20%.',
    source: 'American Forests',
  },

  growthRate: {
    title: 'Understanding Growth Rates',
    body: 'Fast-growing trees (like Tulip Poplar, Red Maple) provide quick shade but may have weaker wood and shorter lifespans. Slow-growing trees (like White Oak, Ginkgo) develop denser wood and can live for centuries. A balanced planting plan mixes growth rates for both immediate impact and long-term resilience.',
    source: 'Arbor Day Foundation',
  },

  soilType: {
    title: 'Soil and Tree Health',
    body: 'Soil type determines water drainage, nutrient availability, and root development. Clay soils hold moisture but can suffocate roots; sandy soils drain quickly and need more watering. Matching tree species to your soil type dramatically improves survival rates and long-term health.',
    source: 'USDA NRCS Soil Survey',
  },

  rootSystems: {
    title: 'Root Systems and Infrastructure',
    body: 'Tree roots typically extend 2-3 times beyond the canopy drip line. Shallow-rooted species (like Silver Maple) can lift sidewalks and damage foundations, while deep-rooted species (like White Oak) are less likely to cause surface damage. Proper species selection prevents costly infrastructure repairs.',

  utilityConflicts: {
    title: 'Trees and Power Lines',
    body: 'Trees that grow into power lines cause outages, fire hazards, and require expensive pruning. The ISA recommends planting only trees that mature under 25 feet tall within 20 feet of power lines. Larger trees should be planted at least 50 feet away from overhead utilities.',
    source: 'ISA Utility Arboriculture Guidelines',
  },

  spacing: {
    title: 'Why Spacing Matters',
    body: 'Crowded trees compete for sunlight, water, and nutrients, leading to weak growth and disease susceptibility. Proper spacing (typically 60-80% of mature canopy spread) ensures each tree reaches its full potential. Under-spaced trees also create maintenance headaches as they mature.',
    source: 'Urban Forest Management Guide',
  },

  co2Absorption: {
    title: 'CO2 Absorption Rates',
    body: 'Young saplings absorb relatively little CO2 as they establish root systems. Absorption increases dramatically during the active growth phase (years 10-30) and peaks when the canopy reaches full size. Mature trees continue absorbing CO2 while also storing significant carbon in their wood.',
    source: 'USDA Forest Service',
  },

  cooling: {
    title: 'Natural Cooling Effect',
    body: 'Trees cool their surroundings through two mechanisms: shade (blocking solar radiation from heating surfaces) and evapotranspiration (releasing water vapor that absorbs heat). Strategic placement of 3-4 trees around a building can reduce air conditioning needs by 20-50%.',
    source: 'US Department of Energy',
  },
